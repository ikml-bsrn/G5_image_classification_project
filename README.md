# WiSAR: Image Classification for Wilderness Search and Rescue

## Overview
This project evaluates different YOLO object detection models for person detection in Wilderness Search and Rescue (WiSAR) missions using RGB imagery. The goal is to identify which YOLO version best balances accuracy, speed, and robustness in complex outdoor environments.

## Background
WiSAR missions are often hindered by challenging terrain, occlusions, and low visibility. Traditional search methods are slow and inefficient. Modern computer vision techniques like YOLO have shown promise in improving person detection. This project builds on prior research to benchmark YOLO models in SAR conditions using publicly available RGB datasets.

## Methodology
Data Sources: WiSARD (RGB and thermal)

**Workflow**:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Dataset review and selection.
- Training and fine-tuning YOLO models (v5, v8 and v11)
- Evaluation based on recall, mAP, precision, and inference time.
- Hyperparameter tuning to improve performance.
  
**Tools**: Ultralytics YOLO, Python, GitHub, Google Drive, Gooogle Colab, Visual Studio Code.

**Ethical Considerations**: Addressed dataset bias and transparency using the FATES framework.

## Results

Findings to be reported soon.

Final evaluations and report submission scheduled for May 22.
